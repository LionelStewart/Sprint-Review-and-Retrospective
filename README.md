# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

	I interpret user needs by creating a list of the requirements that the program needs to fulfill. I implement those requirements into a program by breaking each list item into smaller items that can be completed by a computer. User stories helps with this process by including the requirement name, description, and success criteria.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by creating components which possess the required functionality and then combine them to creating a functional program. I hope to incorporate sprints into my future development work to make this process more efficient and proactively deal with any potential problems.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means to write programs that function according to the user story and to exchange advice and concerns with the team in order to improve productivity.
